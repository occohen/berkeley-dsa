Dynamic programming
breaking down problems into smaller problems, solves each subproblem only once


recursive fibonacci = O(2^n) time, O(n) space in the stack for recursive
stack is limited to the height of the tree

two approaches to dynamic programming -- top down and bottom up
top down is known as memoization
optimization technique that stores expensive function calls
caches data in a container like a hash table
